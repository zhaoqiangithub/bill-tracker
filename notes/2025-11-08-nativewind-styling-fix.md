# NativeWind styling fix

- Added `global.css`, Metro NativeWind integration, and Tailwind preset to restore `className` styles across the app.
- Updated Babel/TS config plus CSS module types to ensure Expo Router loads compiled styles without runtime errors.

## Neon dark UI refresh

- Swapped the entire tab stack, shared components, and modals to a neon-on-carbon visual system that mirrors the provided reference shots.
- Rebuilt cards, charts, FloatingActionBar, and forms with gradients, custom palettes, and localized copy to deliver a cohesive dark theme across Home, Statistics, Wallet, and Profile.
